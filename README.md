**`Software Engineer / Student`**

I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Engineer and a student at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. Passionate about building user-friendly applications, exploring cutting-edge technologies, and solving real-world problems through code. I love AI tools and tinkering with LLM's like GPT or Claude.
